# Word Wrangler game (mini-project)

My implemetation of Mini-project #2 - Word Wrangler game for course "[Principles of Computing (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2?specialization=computer-fundamentals)" by RICE University on Coursera.

### Overview (from course project description page)

In this mini-project we will create a simple word game. The game will take an input word and then generate all valid words that can be created using the letters in the input word. You will then play the game by guessing all of the words. The objective of this mini-project is to work with ordered lists and recursion. While it is possible to write the functions in other ways, we strongly encourage you to follow the spirit of the mini-project. The only way to become more comfortable with recursion is to write recursive functions!

We have provided a working GUI and a class to manage the state of the game. You will be responsible for writing several helper functions. These functions will be used by the provided code in order to build the list of valid words that are composed of letters from the input word.

### Implementation

In this mini-project you should not use $\color{red}{\verb|set|}$, $\color{red}{\verb|sorted|}$, or $\color{red}{\verb|sort|}$. Don't be surprised when you lose points if you do. Again, the point of the mini-project is for you to improve your skills in working with ordered lists and recursion, not to write the most compact code possible using Python built-in functions/methods. It is important to understand the concepts involved in working with ordered data, as you will be able to apply those concepts to a much wider range of problems in the future. Further, not every language has efficient support for this type of data, so it is also important to understand how these functions might be implemented.

**Important:** *None* of these functions should mutate their inputs. You must leave the inputs as they are and return new lists.
